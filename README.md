# Game-Project

This was a fun side project which gave me insight into PyGame. 

It is a demonstration of the classic arcade invaders game, with a spin on shooting asteroids that generates coins.

The asteroids also collide with each other adding another game dynamic.

After each level, the speed and frequency asteroids come increases.

This was such a fun task and anyone interested ion programming should learn how to make video games. Even though my game is quite simple, 
the logic to make a video game stretched me.

Enjoy!
